# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Repository

This repository contains projects and resources for machine learning and deep learning applications. The main focus is on training and evaluating models using structured datasets and serialized model artifacts.

## Repository Structure

- **`ANN_Model_(DL)_ML_Project.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook implementing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for deep learning tasks. Includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. This notebook demonstrates a step-by-step workflow for building and deploying an ANN model using TensorFlow and Keras. It includes:
  - Data cleaning and preparation
  - Model architecture design
  - Training and validation
  - Performance evaluation with metrics

- **`Mobile_Data_set_ML_Project.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook for a machine learning project that analyzes a dataset related to mobile data trends. It includes:
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
  - Feature engineering and preprocessing
  - Model training using scikit-learn algorithms
  - Evaluation metrics and insights into the model's predictions

- **`rfc.pkl`**: A pre-trained Random Forest Classifier model serialized using Python's pickle module. This model can be used for inference on structured datasets. Steps to use this file:
  - Load the model using pickle.
  - Prepare the input data in the same format as used during training.
  - Perform predictions with the `predict` method and analyze results.

## Requirements

To run the notebooks and use the saved model, the following dependencies are required:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib seaborn
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter notebooks to explore the projects:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Use the `rfc.pkl` file for model inference. Here's a sample code snippet:

   ```python
   import pickle
   import numpy as np

   # Load the model
   with open('rfc.pkl', 'rb') as file:
       model = pickle.load(file)

   # Example input for prediction
   sample_input = np.array([[feature1, feature2, feature3, ...]])

   # Predict
   prediction = model.predict(sample_input)
   print(f"Predicted Class: {prediction}")
   ```

## Key Features

- Implementation of an ANN model for deep learning tasks.
- Machine learning analysis of mobile datasets.
