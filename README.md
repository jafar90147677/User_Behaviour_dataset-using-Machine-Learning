# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Repository

This repository contains projects and resources for machine learning and deep learning applications. The main focus is on training and evaluating models using structured datasets and serialized model artifacts.

## Repository Structure

- **`ANN_Model_(DL)_ML_Project.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook implementing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for deep learning tasks. Includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **`Mobile_Data_set_ML_Project.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook for a machine learning project focused on analyzing and predicting trends from a mobile dataset.
- **`rfc.pkl`**: Pre-trained Random Forest Classifier model saved in pickle format for reuse and inference.

## Requirements

To run the notebooks and use the saved model, the following dependencies are required:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib seaborn
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter notebooks to explore the projects:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Use the `rfc.pkl` file for model inference. Here's a sample code snippet:

   ```python
   import pickle
   import numpy as np

   # Load the model
   with open('rfc.pkl', 'rb') as file:
       model = pickle.load(file)

   # Example input for prediction
   sample_input = np.array([[feature1, feature2, feature3, ...]])

   # Predict
   prediction = model.predict(sample_input)
   print(f"Predicted Class: {prediction}")
   ```

## Key Features

- Implementation of an ANN model for deep learning tasks.
